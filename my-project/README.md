# ⏳ Countdown Timer Hub

Welcome to **Countdown Timer Hub** — a simple and intuitive web app where users can create customized countdowns for events, tasks, or study sessions. Whether you're tracking time until a meeting starts or creating a flowtime session, this app has you covered!

## 🌟 Features

- **Date & Time Timer Setup**  
  Choose any future date and time, enter a short description (e.g. “Birthday” or “Project Deadline”), and start your countdown.

- **Preset Timers for Quick Use**  
  Tap one of the preset buttons (`5 Min`, `15 Min`, `Flowtime (25 Min)`) to instantly start a quick session.

- **Progress Bar Visualization**  
  Each countdown displays a colored progress bar that shrinks in real time as time passes.

- **Pause and Resume Support**  
  Temporarily stop any timer and resume it with a click.

- **Custom Event Label**  
  Name each countdown to clearly track what you're timing.

- **Multiple Theme Options**  
  Switch between Light 🌞, Dark 🌙, and Blue 🔵 themes using the dropdown menu.

- **Alarm Sound & Browser Notification**  
  When the timer reaches zero, you’ll hear a ringtone and get a desktop notification (if permission is granted).

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for design and theming
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for timer logic, interactivity, and notifications
- **Netlify** for hosting (Live at [countertimer.netlify.app](https://countertimer.netlify.app))

## 📦 File Structure

- `index.html` – The main page with all input controls and the timer display
- `style.css` – Styles for the layout, themes, and animations
- `script.js` – Handles timer functionality, preset options, notifications, and pause/resume logic
- `alarm.mp3` – Alert sound when timers finish

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Enter a future date and description.**
2. **Click “Add Timer”** to start a countdown.
3. Or choose one of the preset timers for quick sessions.
4. When time's up, the screen will update and an alarm will sound.

> Make sure your browser allows notifications and sound for best experience!

## 🔔 Notifications

The app requests permission to send browser notifications when a timer finishes. If allowed, you'll receive a pop-up with the event name.

## 📌 Additional Notes

- The page can support **multiple timers** running at the same time.
- Timers are not saved after page reload — this app is ideal for quick, short-term timing.
